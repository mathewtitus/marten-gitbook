# Data

The dataset we use has been collected from 26 marten individuals. Researchers mapped likely marten habitat and chose a random selection of locations to monitor, deploying one or, more commonly, two cameras and bait to draw in the martens.

The camera feeds were retrieved and reviewed manually, and sites that were visited by the target species were returned to and trapped. Successful captures allowed researchers to sedate and collar the martens before releasing them in the same location.

Data is gathered for one to two weeks before recapture is attempted and, if successful, the individual may be outfitted with a charged collar for another deployment. The 26 individuals were each monitored for a deployment of approximately two weeks, with one individual (F01) being monitored for a second deployment.

See Table 1 for metadata on the observations collected. The following subsections discuss the particulars of the devices and the time series collected.

## Location data

Collar GPS sensors are battery-powered and so seek to record location data at regular intervals so that energy can be conserved between communications to satellites. When a location record is attempted, the collar attempts to contact an array of satellites; reaching a greater number of satellites tends to give a more accurate estimate of the animal's location, while if too few are reached no record is made. Since martens are fond of using structures and burrows, the collar's signals can often be attenuated by earth and vegetation. The collars typically experience \[MEASURE OF ERROR], and we observe that the time series exhibit a number of clearly erroneous readings.

## Accelerometer data

Complementing the geospatial location data, the collars are also outfitted with an accelerometer, which measures the collar's acceleration along three orthogonal axes in meters per second squared (m/s^2). This gives another lens by which we can study the marten's activities. For example, a fixed location and low accelerations likely corresponds to resting, while high accelerations may indicate vertical movement, digging, or \[some other activity].
