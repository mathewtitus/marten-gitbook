# Introduction

Hunting, trapping, and habitat destruction through logging operations have led to population declines in a number of terrestrial mammals, including the Humboldt marten (\*Martes caurina humboldtensis\*). This small but mighty predator persists in Northern California and Southwestern Oregon, though it is considered threatened under the Endangered Species Act classification.

In order to better understand the species' challenges and habitat use, a number of recent studies have attempted to observe martens using remote cameras and through collaring. However, the data gathered often requires an interpretive effort to relate the animals' behaviors to the surroundings, e.g. vegetation or time of day.

This study uses marten movement data and a modern statistical analysis to infer the animals' activity states (traveling, resting, etc.), providing insight into their habitat use.
